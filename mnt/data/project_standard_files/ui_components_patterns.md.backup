# UI Components and Patterns
## Buttons
### Types (Variants)
- `Primary` — main action (CTA)
- `Secondary` — secondary actions
- `Tertiary/Ghost` — less important actions/inside cards
- `Danger` — destructive operations (delete/clear)

### Sizes
- `sm`: Height 32px (used in table/list tools)
- `md`: Height 40px (default)
- `lg`: Height 48px (CTA in mobile)

### Behavior Rules
- There should only be **one main CTA** per page (unless specified).
- A disabled button should be clearly marked both in color and cursor/aria.
- In Loading state:
  - The text remains constant or is replaced with a Spinner.
  - Button width should remain constant to prevent UI shift.

### Focus
- All buttons should have a visible **focus-visible** state (for keyboard navigation).

## Inputs and Forms
### General Rules
- A **Label** should always exist (Placeholder is not a label).
- Error messages should be short and useful.
- States: default, focus, error, disabled.
- Long selectors should support search.

## Cards
- Standard padding.
- Clear surface and subtle hover.
- If clickable, the whole card should be clickable.

## Modals/Dialogs
- Focus trapping.
- Escape key to close.
- Clear close button.
- Danger modals must have a clear destructive button.

## Toast/Notifications
- Clear and short messages.
- Appropriate display time (3–5s).
- Error messages shouldn't show stack trace.

## Navigation/Layout
- Breadcrumb for deep pages.
- Mobile: Bottom Nav or Hamburger.
- Desktop: Fixed Sidebar/Top Nav.
- RTL-aware.

## Tables and Lists
- Tables:
  - Fixed header (if scrolling).
  - Accessible filter/sorting.
  - Empty and loading states must be standardized.

- Lists:
  - For large data: Virtualization.
  - For mobile: Card or compact Row view.
